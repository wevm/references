# `@wagmi/connectors`

Collection of connectors for wagmi.

## Installation

Install the `@wagmi/connectors` package.

```
npm i @wagmi/connectors
```

## Usage

Configure your wagmi client with connectors!

```tsx
import { configureChains, createClient } from 'wagmi'

import { InjectedConnector } from '@wagmi/connectors/injected'

const { chains, provider } = configureChains(...)

const client = createClient({
  connectors: [
    new InjectedConnector({ chains }),
  ],
  provider,
})
```

> If your bundler supports tree-shaking (most likely), only the used connectors will be included in the bundle, so you don't have to worry about bundle size. 😊
