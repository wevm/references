# References

This repository contains extensive references (ie. chains, connectors, providers, etc) for the wagmi repositories.

The purpose of the references monorepo is so that contributors can open discussions (and PRs) for additional chains, connectors & providers without it polluting the `wagmi` repository itself.

It consists of:

- **[Chains](/packages/chains/)**: An extensive collection of chains (e.g. mainnet, polygon, bsc, etc) to use in wagmi.
- **Connectors** (Soon): A collection of connectors (e.g. Injected, WalletConnect, etc) to use in wagmi
- **Providers** (Soon): A collection of providers (e.g. Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, etc) to use in wagmi.
